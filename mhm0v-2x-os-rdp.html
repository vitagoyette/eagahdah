This is my first foray into VFIO. Hope is to consolidate an existing Mac, gaming PC and sundry low performance VMs/containers currently on a Linux server, all into one machine. The VMs/containers will likely go onto the host, which will be Ubuntu or Fedora, so really it's just 2 main VMs with various passthrough requirements. My biggest fear is buying the wrong hardware and having to do returns over and over and trying out different things, but suspect inevitable . устройство с использованием Parallels Client (ранее клиент 2X RDP). . RDP client allows you to access Parallels RAS from any device Hi everyone! I'm currently designing my first UnRAID build and I am deciding between the two AMD CPUs in the title. The 2600 is newer and one of the most highly-recommended all-around Ryzen processors, but the 1700 is 8-core/16-thread, albeit has a slower clock speed and is a generation older. I've never used UnRAID before but I've read that thread count is very important because you can allocate threads to a VM or Docker container manually. Both processors are generally Рейтинг: 2,8 - 19 отзывов - БесплатноOS X 10.7.3 или более поздняя версия, 64-разрядный процессор.

Fair warning, this one is a little long. I'm a longtime virtualbox user and recently I decided to start running linux in a VM again after being disappointed with the Windows Linux subsystem in Windows 10. (the I/O performance is terrible FWIW) Plus it is nice to have a desktop and X applications available. TL:DR version: I went through every major linux distro and found the 3d acceleration really slow in virtualbox. Virtualbox also lacks 2d acceleration for linux, so its 3d accelerated. 29 июн 2010  Компания 2X Software анонсировала выход продукта 2X CloudClient Operating System, позволяющего получить доступ к содержимому.

Hi Guys, I have a rather unique situation. VMware has a feature where we can connect to the VM console via VNC. I use this a lot The way you connect to them is by pointing to the ESXi IP address and to a unique port for each VM. Because of VMware vmotion, sometimes the IP address changes and breaks my connection scripts. So I had an idea - use HAProxy! My plan is, for each VM: VIP IP address:5901 node ESX1:5901 node ESX2:5901 node ESX3:5901

So, after a year, I've had a number of changes that I think need to happen to my rack. Some of which is because I've gotten "new" equipment that I want to use, but know precisely jack-all about. Here's what I have, and I'm looking for best practices. One exception, switches will not be mounted in back of rack. This is due to the difficulty of reaching the back of the rack once it is wheeled into place. Sorry back switchers; but I gotta roll my way. (places shades over eyes and looks smug).

Hello guys, I need some advice regarding the hardware and virtualization software for home lab for R&D software development purposes.

I posted a build to /r/buildapc and someone suggested Mint as an OS.
